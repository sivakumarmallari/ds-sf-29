Read and evaluate the following problem statement:
Determine which free-tier customers will covert to paying customers, using demographic data collected at signup (age, gender, location, and profession) and customer useage data (days since last log in, and activity score 1 = active user, 0= inactive user) based on Hooli data from Jan-Apr 2015.
--------------------------------------------------


1. What is the outcome?
ANS: determing who are all will get converted as paying customers

2. What are the predictors/covariates?
ANS: activity score, Age (Age is considered for hypothesis verification)

3. What timeframe is this data relevent for?
ANS: Jan-Apr 2015.

4. What is the hypothesis?
Ans: Age is inversly propotional to customer becoming Paying customer from free-tier.

Let's get started with our dataset

1. Create a data dictionary
Answer:



2. What is the outcome?
Answer: X (Age) is inversly propotional to Y(customer)

3. What are the predictors/covariates?
Answer: activity score, Age (Age is considered for hypothesis verification)

4. What timeframe is this data relevent for?
Answer: Jan-Apr 2015.

4. What is the hypothesis?
Answer: X (Age) is inversly propotional to Y(customer)

Using the above information, write a well-formed problem statement. 
ANS: Predecting the Number of free-tier customers becoming Paying customers by measuring the Activity score, Age will also be used because younger a person is more likely that person will try new things.

1. What are the goals of the exploratory analysis?
Ans: Deriving insights to a maximum extent.

2a. What are the assumptions of the distribution of data?
Ans: Normal Distribution.

2b. How will determine the distribution of your data?
Ans: By plotting the observations in a graph.

3a. How might outliers impact your analysis?
Ans: Fat Tail


3b. How will you test for outliers?
Ans: by calculating Standard Deviation


4a. What is colinearity?
Ans: one variable can be predicted from another variable with substantial accuricy, for example sqft of a house is directly propotional to price of house.

4b. How will you test for colinearity?
Ans: by observing the both the variables are corelated.

5. What is your exploratory analysis plan? [Using the above information, write an exploratory analysis plan that would allow you or a colleague to reproduce your analysis 1 year from now.]
Ans: by using the data analysis workflow.
